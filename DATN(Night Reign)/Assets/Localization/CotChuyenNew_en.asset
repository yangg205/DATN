    m_Localized: Which path will you choose to confront the darkness? Whatever you
      choose, remember that only those with light in their hearts can survive the
      reign of night. Your choice will shape Aurora's destiny.

    m_Localized: "You finally arrived\u2026 Do not ask me who you are, you chose
      to forget. A price to pay to exist in this night. But I know this: the light
      has not completely faded and you might be the last one strong enough to rekindle
      it. Aurora's dawn can still return, if you have the will."

    m_Localized: "From the ashes, the one chosen by the Tower of Light was born,

    m_Localized: "The Umbra \u2013 an entity born from Aurora's darkness and fear.
      It devoured not only life and souls but also memories. As light faded, the
      Tower Guardians \u2013 great warriors who once swore to protect Aurora \u2013
      fell and became servants of the night, soulless puppets of the Umbra."

  - m_Id: 6713674424321
    m_Localized: But then the Tower of Light, where the people of Aurora once boasted,
      collapsed and night began to reign. Night was not merely the absence of light,
      but a living entity, consuming everything.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6713674424320
    m_Localized: Aurora was once protected by the Tower of Light, connecting the

    m_Localized: "This is the Bonfire \u2013 the last remnant of the Tower of Light.
      Touch it, and you can rest, heal your wounds, and recall lost memories. But
      be careful, surrounding enemies will be drawn to its light."

    m_Localized: "Flamekeeper\u2026 Does he still remember me? I thought he had forgotten
      the weak like us, those left behind in the night. You carry a strange, rare
      light\u2026 a glimmer of hope I thought no longer existed. The next Shard\u2026
      it fell into the hands of Sentinel, who betrayed the Tower of Light, who chose
      darkness because the light abandoned him. He dwells in the Misty Cavern, where
      your breath turns to ice in your veins."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6713674424352
    m_Localized: I once swore never to let darkness pass this gate. But the light
      itself abandoned me, abandoned all the weak. You come to steal the Shard? Do
      you think you're strong enough to take it from me? The very thing I protected
      with this solitude?

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6713674424356
    m_Localized: Do you know? He was once the first to enter the Tower of Light with
      Flamekeeper, his closest friend. But the light saved no one. It only chose
      a few and abandoned the rest. That's why he betrayed, not for darkness, but
      for despair.

      If you are here for the shard, then know it is held by Warden, once the Guardian
      of this forest. He has forgotten his name, his duty, now just a nightmare with
      bleeding roots and deathly whispers. He is the pain of this forest.
