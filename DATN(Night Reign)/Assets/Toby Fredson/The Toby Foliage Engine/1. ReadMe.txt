 ○ Summary


  Simple yet intricate, TTFEL’s single-pivot system mimics multi-pivot foliage motion, inspired by Pivot Painter.


  Bring your game worlds to life with the Toby Foliage Engine - Light (TTFEL), a streamlined shader solution for stunning, wind-swept foliage.


  The Toby Foliage Engine - Light (TTFEL) delivers optimized, realistic wind and plant shading with a user-friendly interface. These Amplify Shader Editor-crafted shaders integrate seamlessly with PBR shading, using mesh-based vertex volumes for dynamic wind effects customizable via material settings. Perfect for game foliage, TTFEL balances performance and quality. There is no need for complex conversion steps, as the shaders streamline the process.


 ○ Limitations


  The Light version offers essential features with a single wind type. Amplify shader functions are unavailable, requiring code-based shader access. Upgrade to the full version for all features: The Toby Foliage Engine


  * Purchase the vegetation assets pack separately: Vegetation Pack - Toby Foliage Engine Assets


  x Static batching is not supported.
  x Only the latest LTS Unity versions are officially supported.
  x GPU instancing is not supported out of the box and requires third-party tools
